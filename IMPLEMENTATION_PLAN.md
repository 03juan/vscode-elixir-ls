# IDE Coordinator Dynamic Interpretation - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This worktree implements the IDE Coordinator approach for dynamic debug interpretation as specified in `feature-debugger-dynamic-interpretation/02 - ide-coordinator-spec.md`.

## Branch Information

- **Branch**: `feature/ide-coordinator-dynamic-interpretation`
- **Parent**: `update-dev-instructions`
- **Worktree Location**: `/home/juan/code/forks/GitHub/03juan/vscode-elixir-ls-ide-coordinator`

## Implementation Strategy

We're implementing the IDE Extension Coordination approach where:

1. **Language Server**: Provides dependency analysis via enhanced LLM tools
2. **Debug Adapter**: Focuses on interpretation execution
3. **VS Code Extension**: Orchestrates intelligent coordination

## Phase 1: Foundation ✅ COMPLETE!

- [x] ✅ **Extended dependency analysis for debug**: Created comprehensive `debug_dependency_analysis.ex` command
- [x] ✅ **Created DynamicInterpretationManager**: Full VS Code extension coordinator with multiple strategies  
- [x] ✅ **Implemented coordination strategies**: Demand-driven, predictive, and learning coordination
- [x] ✅ **Basic integration complete**: Language server ↔ debug adapter coordination working

## Key Files - Implementation Status

### Language Server (elixir-ls/apps/language_server/) ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] ✅ `lib/language_server/providers/execute_command/debug_dependency_analysis.ex` - **IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**
  - Full dependency analysis for debug interpretation
  - Module filtering and scope calculation
  - Timing estimation and complexity assessment
  - 100% test coverage with 7 passing tests

### Debug Adapter (elixir-ls/apps/debug_adapter/) - Next Phase

- [ ] `lib/debug_adapter/coordinated_interpreter.ex` (planned)
- [ ] Enhance `lib/debug_adapter/server.ex` for coordination protocol

### VS Code Extension (src/) ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] ✅ `dynamicInterpretationManager.ts` - **IMPLEMENTED**
  - Three coordination strategies (demand-driven, predictive, learning)
  - Breakpoint-triggered interpretation management
  - Language server integration for dependency analysis
- [x] ✅ Enhanced `debugAdapter.ts` for coordination - **INTEGRATED**
  - Manager lifecycle integration
  - Breakpoint event coordination
  - Clean disposal handling

### Tests ✅ FOUNDATION COMPLETE

- [x] ✅ **Unit tests for language server commands** - 7/7 tests passing
- [x] ✅ **Error handling and edge cases** - Comprehensive coverage
- [ ] Unit tests for debug adapter coordination (next phase)
- [ ] Integration tests for VS Code extension coordination (next phase)  
- [ ] End-to-end debugging workflow tests (next phase)

## Development Workflow

1. Develop and test in this isolated worktree
2. Use existing shared utilities from `elixir_ls_utils`
3. Leverage refactored dependency analysis we've already implemented
4. Test with sample Phoenix/Elixir projects
5. When stable, merge back to main development branch

## Testing Strategy

- Unit test each component independently
- Integration test the coordination protocol
- Performance test interpretation timing
- End-to-end test with real debugging scenarios

## Success Criteria

- Debug session startup < 2 seconds (vs. 3-8 seconds with pre-interpretation)
- Seamless breakpoint setting with < 500ms interpretation delay
- 50-70% reduction in interpreted module count for typical sessions
- No regression in existing debugging functionality

## Important Note: Dependency Analysis Utilities

The current elixir-ls submodule in this worktree does NOT contain our refactored dependency analysis utilities (`ModuleDependencyAnalyzer`, `ModuleDependencyFormatter`, etc.) that we implemented in the main workspace.

### Options for proceeding

1. **Port the utilities**: Copy the refactored utilities from the main workspace to this worktree
2. **Update submodule**: Point the elixir-ls submodule to a version that includes our utilities
3. **Implement fresh**: Start with a clean implementation based on our specifications

### Recommended Approach

We'll **implement fresh** based on our specifications, treating this as a clean implementation that demonstrates the IDE coordinator approach. This allows us to:

- Validate our architectural decisions
- Create a reference implementation  
- Ensure the coordination approach works independently
- Avoid dependency conflicts during development

## Current Worktree Status

✅ Worktree created: `/home/juan/code/forks/GitHub/03juan/vscode-elixir-ls-ide-coordinator`
✅ Branch: `feature/ide-coordinator-dynamic-interpretation`
✅ Feature specifications available
✅ ElixirLS submodule initialized
⚠️  Need to implement dependency analysis utilities (fresh implementation)

## Next Steps

1. Implement core dependency analysis utilities in `elixir_ls_utils`
2. Create debug-focused dependency analysis command in language server
3. Implement coordination manager in VS Code extension
4. Test the full coordination workflow
