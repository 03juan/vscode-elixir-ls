### v0.0.5: 11 Jun 2017
  - Windows support

### v0.0.4: 10 Jun 2017
  - Updated ElixirLS to package its apps as escripts and updated client to handle it. This should fix the error `(Mix) Could not start application language_server: could not find application file: language_server.app`. Windows, however, is still broken.
  - Began a changelog :)
